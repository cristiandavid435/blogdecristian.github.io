                        <h2>Crime and Punishment</h2>
                            <p>Justice is a mirror where humanity observes its own shadow. Crime is not just an individual act but a symptom of the cracks in the social fabric. Is a criminal born, or does indifference, poverty, and desperation shape them?

                            Punishment, on the other hand, aims to restore balance, but does it truly solve the problem, or does it simply turn a blind eye to its causes? In some societies, sentencing is harsh, relentless, but what happens when the punishment is more brutal than the crime itself? Prison doesn’t always redeem; sometimes, it deepens the darkness that already existed</p>
