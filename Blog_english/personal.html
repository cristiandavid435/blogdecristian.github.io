                            This image presents a conceptual diagram titled "Personal learning environment," which illustrates an individual's learning strategy for improving in English and software development. The diagram is organized around the central phrase "MY PERSONAL LEARNING ENVIRONMENT FOR ENGLISH AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT."

                            It is divided into several key areas, represented as interconnected clouds, covering different skills and resources:

                            SPEAKING: Focuses on practicing pronunciation and conversations in the real world.
                            LISTENING: Includes listening to music (with a specific YouTube link), texts and podcasts, and practicing pronunciation and vocabulary.
                            READING: The mentioned activities are reading posts, news, and descriptive texts.
                            WRITING: Comprises completing tests, researching grammar, and solving quizzes.
                            RESOURCES AND TOOLS: Lists various useful tools such as Natural Readers, W3Schools, YouTube, Q/A, Liveworksheets, Dictionaries (specifically Bravebird reference), social networks, translators, and Google.
                            IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT: Highlights the use of code editors, setting up languages in technical English, and documentation.
                            Essentially, the diagram shows a holistic approach to learning, combining the practice of fundamental language skills with the use of specific tools and resources for software development, all within a personalized learning environment.

                                    Justice is a mirror where humanity observes its own shadow. Crime is not just an individual act but a symptom of the cracks in the social fabric. Is a criminal born, or does indifference, poverty, and desperation shape them?
