                    <h2>Critical thinking and media Literacy</h2>
                        <p>
                            With news available at the tap of a finger, keyboard, or remote, we are often exposed to a barrage of news media. Some of it is high quality, informational news, while other pieces may be riddled with biases, inaccuracies, and misinformation. That’s why it’s so important for students to learn to properly evaluate the news and content they’re consuming.

                            We live in the age of information, but also in the age of misinformation. Never before have we had instant access to so much data, news, and opinions. However, in this ocean of information, truth and lies mix dangerously, creating a reality where believing something doesn't necessarily mean it's true.

                            Social media and digital platforms have amplified a concerning phenomenon: the rapid spread of unverified content. Sensational headlines, manipulated images, statistics taken out of context—all designed to grab our attention and provoke emotional reactions. In this game of manipulation, are we truly in control of our opinions, or are we being subtly guided by a wave of carefully structured information meant to influence us?

                                <p>Justice is a mirror where humanity observes its own shadow. Crime is not just an individual act but a symptom of the cracks in the social fabric. Is a criminal born, or does indifference, poverty, and desperation shape them?</p>
