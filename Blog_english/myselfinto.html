                            Hello! I'm Cristiaan, a curious and eager-to-learn individual currently studying software development at SENA. My main goal is to complete this technologist program, then pursue an engineering degree, and grow professionally, all while learning English.

                                <p>Justice is a mirror where humanity observes its own shadow. Crime is not just an individual act but a symptom of the cracks in the social fabric. Is a criminal born, or does indifference, poverty, and desperation shape them?</p>
